      <div class="main-content"> Does this only say cats only? Yes, we love cats so much that we are willing to do a cat only insurance, cats are less likely to get taken to the veterinarian than a dog, to combat this we've created a insurance only for our furry friends who like the purr.
        <!-- From granting insurances to tagging cats, we do it all. Why? Because we love what we do. On average, we have collectively been the top 3 insurances that cat owners go to for the past 10 years, wait that's when we were born! You never know, your cat could be a checkup away from being diagnosed with some life threatening disease, it's best to be insured at that time. Getting your cat insured is as easy as clicking on that insurance button below.    -->
